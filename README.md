### Pre-commit checks

Before opening a pull request you have to install `pre-commit`s and run it to check black, flake8 and mypy.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run

pre-commit install
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: new stuff"
```

### Conventional commits

Try to stick as much as possible to conventional commits guidelines for your commit messages.
